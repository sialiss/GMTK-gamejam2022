Use WASD or Arrow Keys to move by rolling.  Your top number is your current ability, which pulses automatically every other instant.  2 allows to heal, others are attacks of varying patterns. Colliding with enemies progresses the pawn bar at the bottom. You lose as soon as it is completed. Destroying enemies gets you points.
